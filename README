# MechaniClaw

This is just a fun project to create mechanical arms backpack for Aypierre in QSMP.

It's just a chest piece that give Haste 2 (I mean 4 arms ...)

Also have some animations for :

- Idle
- Jumping
- Crouching
- Dead/Sleeping
- Swimming
- Sprinting

It has a separate Item render when in hand/gui/ground.

Do whatever you want with it, change code, haste, animations/model... it was just my first minecraft modding project

The animations and model are not perfect but I'm not a professional !

*(Don't forget to change lore in the lang json :D)*
